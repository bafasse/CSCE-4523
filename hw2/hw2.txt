CSCE 4523: Database Management Systems
Spring 2018
Assignment Two
Due: Thursday, February 22, 2018 at the beginning of class


Each task is worth 6 points.  You may refer to Oracle Notes Part Two for help with this assignment.  Do NOT use join or any other binary operations; instead, use sub-queries wherever
needed.  Do not use more than one query for a task.  Do not display columns that are not required in the result.

Run your queries in SSH or PuTTY terminal instead of on a web browser or a GUI interface.  Create a spool file to capture the output of your queries for tasks 1 through 5.  Turn in a hard
copy of your spool file in class on Feb. 22 and email your queries (NOT QUERY RESULTS) before class time to mshukla@email.uark.edu with Subject line "DBMS Assignment Two".  The queries
must be in clean text (without any unnecessary characters) in the body of the email, NOT in an ATTACHED FILE.  Also, make sure to write your name in the email.

Check with me if you need further clarification on any of the following tasks.

Tasks:

1.  Determine the number of trips approved (as listed in Trip table) for employees of Marketing department.  Print the number.

2.  Print names of employees who have been approved to take a trip but have not submitted any receipts yet.  Do not print the same employee's name more than once.

3.  Find the trip with the highest estimated cost and print the name and contact person of the department where the corresponding employee works.

4.  Print the names of the department none of whose employees have been listed to take a trip (as per the Trip table).

5.  Print the names of cities for which the corresponding trip's estimated cost is less than the average transportation cost.  Your result must not show a city name more than once.
