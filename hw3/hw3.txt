CSCE 4523: Database Management Systems
Spring 2018
Assignment Three
Due: Thursday, March 8, 2018 at the beginning of class


Each task carries 6 points.  You may refer to Oracle notes Part Three for help with this assignment.  Use joins instead of subqueries whenever possible.  Display only the required columns
in the result.

Run your queries in SSH or PuTTY terminal.  Create a spool file to capture the output of your queries.  Turn in a hard copy of your spool file in class on March 8 and email just your
queries before class time to mshukla@email.uark.edu with Subject line "DBMS Assignment Three".  The queries must be in clean text in the body of the email; no unnecessary characters must
be present.  Also, add your name to
the email.

Check with me if you need further clarification on any of the following tasks or on the materials on Oracle notes.

Tasks:

1.  For each expense type, determine the total expense amount.  The output should show the expense type and the corresponding total amount.  Print the result in ascending order of amount.

2.  Show the total number of trips approved for employees of each department.  If none of the employees of a department have any approved trip, the department information should not appear
in the result.  Your output should show the department names and total number of trips.

3.  Query the Trip table to show the number of distinct days when both a departure and a return occur.  Note: They need not be for the same trip.

4.  For each approved trip, show the corresponding employee name, departure date, name of the city the employee visited, and the receipt submission date (if receipt has been submitted).

5.  Find out the trips for which the estimated cost is less than the actual expense and print those two costs along with the corresponding trip id.
