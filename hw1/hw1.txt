The project schema is available on class web page.  Click on the link "Project Schema".

Create the tables and add at least 10 records to each table.  You may use Part One and Part Two of Oracle notes provided on class web page for help.

You must use the schema EXACTLY as defined.  Otherwise, you may have to redo the first assignment later (which will not be graded again) in order to continue with the remaining
assignments.  So, do it right the first time.

Please use the ssh or PuTTY interface to complete this and all future assignments.


What to turn in:
=============

1. Show all tables you have created.  Use the command
        Select * from cat;

2. Show the schema of each table.  Use the command
        desc tablename
    Replace the word "tablename" with actual name of each table.

3. Show the primary keys.

4. Show the foreign key(s).

5. Show other constraints (if any) on each table.

6. Finally, show all records in each table.


The commands for tasks 3, 4, and 5 are given below.  Be careful of syntax while typing the following commands (you may copy and paste each of the following three commands and run, rather
than typing each of them).

To show the primary keys:
      select a.owner, a.table_name, column_name primary_key,  a.constraint_name
      from   user_cons_columns a, user_constraints b
      where  a.constraint_name = b.constraint_name and constraint_type = 'P';

   Note the upper case 'P' in the last line of the above command.

To show the foreign keys:
      select a.owner, a.table_name, a.column_name foreign_key,
             b.table_name Referring_table, b.column_name Primary_key
      from   user_cons_columns a, user_cons_columns b, user_constraints c
      where  a.constraint_name = c.constraint_name and c.r_constraint_name = b.constraint_name;

To show all other constraints:
        select owner, table_name, search_condition from
             user_constraints where search_condition is not null;


If you have missed a constraint during table creation and want to add that or need to modify a constraint, please see "Adding and Removing Constraints" section of Part Six of Oracle notes.

To make the output of tasks 3, 4, and 5 look nicer, set the following formats before executing those commands.  The formats should be set from sqlplus (i.e., after logging on to oracle).

         SQL> column owner format a12
         SQL> column table_name format a12
         SQL> column foreign_key format a12
         SQL> column primary_key format a12
         SQL> column referring_table format a15
         SQL> column search_condition format a45


To turn in your output, on SQL prompt, type:
                        spool asgn1

Then execute the commands for tasks 1 through 6 to display the results on screen.  Finally, type:
                        spool off

Exit from sqlplus.  Print the file asgn1.lst from your church.csce.uark.edu account and turn in.


If you need any further explanation, please see me.

==========================================================

IMPORTANT:  After you print and turn in an assignment (either this or the other ones that will be assigned in future), do not modify your tables until the assignment is graded and returned
to you.  I will, when in doubt, check your tables to make sure that the output you turned in was obtained from the tables in your account.
